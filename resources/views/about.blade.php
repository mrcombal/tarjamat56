        <h3 class="text-custom fw-med" style="margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 40px;">A Vision Rooted in Equality and Excellence</h3>
        <p style="line-height: 36px; font-size: 18px; color: #666666; text-align: justify;">Tarjamat LLC was established in 2007 by Prof. Louay Abdulla, a certified ATA EN <> AR translator. Despite sadly passing away in 2021, his vision for the company continues to thrive. Driven by a belief in the underrepresentation and underpayment of women in the translation industry, Prof. Abdulla founded Tarjamat with a strong commitment to gender equality. His legacy lives on through our dedicated team, which is predominantly composed of skilled female managers and linguists.</p>
